# MS DOCS App

MS DOCS App is a simple and intuitive short note-taking application. It features a clean design with the ability to toggle between dark and light themes, and it stores all your notes locally using the browser's `localStorage`, so your data stays on your device.

## Features

- **Themes**: Toggle between dark and light themes to suit your preferences.
- **LocalStorage**: Your notes are saved directly in your browser's localStorage, meaning they will persist across sessions without needing a backend or cloud service.
- **Easy-to-use**: Add, view, and delete notes with a simple interface.
